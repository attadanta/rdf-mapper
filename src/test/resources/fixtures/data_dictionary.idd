SizingPeriod:DesignDay,
      \memo The design day object creates the parameters for the program to create
      \memo the 24 hour weather profile that can be used for sizing as well as
      \memo running to test the other simulation parameters. Parameters in this
      \memo include a date (month and day), a day type (which uses the appropriate
      \memo schedules for either sizing or simple tests), min/max temperatures,
      \memo wind speeds, and solar radiation values.
